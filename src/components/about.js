      <div className="profiles" ><img className="pics" src="https://avatars0.githubusercontent.com/u/48890327?s=400&v=4" alt="Kishor"/><section> <h3> Kishor Pandey </h3> <p>I am a Software Development Apprentice at AWS, Directory Services team. My most recent experience has been handling petroleum at US Army. In the Army, I supported an organization of 500 employee, about 300 motor vehicles and equipment with petroleum products.<br /><br />One reason I particularly am enjoy coding is the challenges we face to build awesome applications. Being a new field, feels like even more challenging. I graduated from Metropolitan State University, Saint Paul MN majoring in Management Information Systems.<br /><br /> Here at Code Fellows, I feel I am learning a lot to become a successful at programming. I like playing ping-pong in my free time. I was born and raised in Pokhara, Nepal which is also a rainy city like Seattle.</p></section></div>

The two greatest traits I value in a person are critical thinking and empathy. I'm getting a tattoo of the word 'indecisive', but I'm not sure where to put it. <br/><br/> I'm new to the field of programming, and hungry to learn more. In a past life I was going to be a math teacher, and those experiences teaching have allowed me to sharpen myself as a learner. I spent 7 months last year training with the US Army, eating dirt and learning the secrets of network administration. Now I am learning Software Development and looking forward to adding even more tools to my belt! <br/><br/> I give a mean explanation of the Monty Hall problem. Born and raised in the PNW - naturally I love the rain. Experienced with customer service and with a mop. My passions include stories, games, puzzles, and horrible puns.</p></section></div>
